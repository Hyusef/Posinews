## Key Features

 
* View only positive news according to subreddit upliftingNews
* Simple and easy to use.

## About
<p> This is an app where i wanted to implement scraping. I couldn't find any good api's for only positive news. so i decided to just scrape the upliftingNews subreddit. </p>

## Tech Stack
* React  
* Node.js 
* Express 
* Material-UI 
* Cheerio


## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hyusef/posinews

# Go into the repository
$ cd posinews

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

## Challenges
This project is not complex so i didn't face that many challenges but i remember it being difficult to scrape the reddit.com website especially the thumbnails since the upliftingNews subreddit requires you click the link to view the website so instead of scraping reddit.com i scraped old.reddit.com to get the thumbnails.
 
## Lessons Learned
* I learnt alot about scraping websites during this project. I learnt about different tools like selenium. I learnt about the legality of scraping, the different methods, data processing, and how many large companies use it for different reasons like price comparisons. I am now familiar with the Cheerio library which uses jquery like syntax.

## Improvements

* I didn't put much effort into designing this app, So it's ugly. I was more focused on the scraping.
